## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the criminal justice system and its relationship with housing insecurity. Specifically, I am interested in researching whether evictions can lead a person to have contact with the criminal justice system and commit low-level crimes.  

```{r}
library(readr)
evictions_ny <- read_csv("C:/Users/nerva/Downloads/Fall 23/Gov 50/Week 4/gov50-final-project/newyork_monthly_2020_2021.csv")
evictions_ny
```
